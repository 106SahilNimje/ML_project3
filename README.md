# 🍽️ Restaurant Cost Prediction using Random Forest

This machine learning project predicts the cost of meals in restaurants based on features like location, votes, online orders, etc. It uses a Random Forest Regressor to achieve accurate predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection and transformation
- Train-test split (with dropped columns: `Restaurant`, `Rating`)
- RandomForestRegressor for prediction
- Evaluation using Mean Absolute Error and R² Score

## 📁 Files

- `restaurant_cost_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing full implementation
- `restaurant_data.csv`: Raw dataset (used for training)
- `model.pkl` *(optional)*: Saved trained model (if included)

## 📊 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git



Install required packages:
pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib

Open and run the notebook:
